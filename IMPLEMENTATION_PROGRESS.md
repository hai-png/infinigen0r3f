## 🔧 Technical Debt & Known Limitations

1. **Node Transpiler**: Currently generates GLSL strings; needs integration with Three.js NodeMaterial
2. **HDRI Loading**: Requires RGBELoader integration and actual HDRI assets
3. **Instance Scattering**: Uses basic geometry placeholders; needs real asset integration
4. **Seeding**: PRNG implemented but not fully integrated across all systems
5. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling; needs comprehensive try/catch and validation
6. **Noise Functions**: Using simple hash-based noise; should integrate proper Simplex/Perlin noise library
7. **Remeshing**: Full remeshing not implemented; requires external geometry processing library
8. **Tag System**: Tag dictionary placeholder; needs spatial indexing implementation
9. **Path Finding**: O(n²) grid initialization; could optimize with spatial hashing for large scenes

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (TODO)
- [ ] Node wrangler connection logic
- [ ] Socket type validation
- [ ] Poisson disk sampling correctness
- [ ] Color temperature conversion accuracy
- [ ] Factory seeding reproducibility

- [ ] Path finding correctness

### Integration Tests (TODO)
- [ ] Full node graph to material compilation
- [ ] Lighting preset scene rendering
- [ ] Instance scatter performance benchmarks
- [ ] End-to-end camera trajectory generation

## 📝 Notes

- All code is fully typed with TypeScript
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation included
- Follows original Infinigen architecture where applicable
- Adapted for Three.js/R3F ecosystem conventions
- New modules (detail, density, path-finding) maintain API compatibility with Python originals
